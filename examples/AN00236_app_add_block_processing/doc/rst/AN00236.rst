Overview

Introduction
............

This demo application takes samples from channel 0 of the summed stereo signal and channels them into a double buffer of configurable size. The output side of the double buffer is processed by a C function implemented in process_buffer.c. 
Arbitrary block processing algorithms can be inserted in that C function. For example algorithms for keyword recognition.

Refer to the AN00218 for additional information.
